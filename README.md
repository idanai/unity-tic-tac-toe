### Saving system

Currently there's a working branch named "saving-system" that has a partially functional saving system, capable of reading and writing both from a text file and `PlayerPrefs`.
However, not all data is saved, and so the loading of a game upon startup is not fully working.

## Notes:

This was my 1st time working with `Addressables`, so if you think something could have been done better, I'd love some tips! You can open an issue or something üôè.
